## **Tips**
---
### **Describe your company**
It would be great if the offer included a company overview, with links to the company's website, linkedin profile or the like. If it'd also link to the careers/job section, it'd be great.
[comment]: <> ( La oferta debe incluir la descripción de la empresa, con enlaces reales a la misma. Idealmente, a su web corporativa, perfil en Linkedin o similar. Si se incluye enlace a la sección de "empleos" de la web, perfecto.)
[comment]: <> (Con esta medida se quiere evitar el efecto "empresa multinacional líder en el sector y en plena expansión busca personas para...". Seas una startup, una PYME, una consultora o una multinacional, dinos quién eres.)
#### This tries to get rid of the " I'm recruiting on behalf of an important  who have various different positions in the UK" or "I'm recruiting for a position with an established and successful software firm" kind of messages. *The contacted person is gonna ask anyway.*

### **Describe the job**
It would be great if the position description included detailed (as much as possible) information about the responsabilities, skills and requirements of the job. Too many buzzwords or the search for ninjas/rockstar is too much. Take a look at the info (most) companies include at StackOverflow jobs (I'm not affiliated in any manner to StackOverflow or any of its subsidiaries, just think they encourage companies to post morre relevant info).
#### It helps candidates consider whether they would be really interested or not. *The contacted person is gonna ask anyway.*

### **Salary**
The job offer should include salary, or at least a **reasonable** salary range (not something like "between 30k and 60k"). Interesting [link from a Forbes contributor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2015/03/30/just-put-the-salary-range-in-your-job-ad-already/)

#### The "we pay as little as possible" philosophy, or the concealment of that information is inefficient. *The contacted person is gonna ask anyway.*
